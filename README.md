# Ansible Patterns

A collection of `ansible` patterns for achieving various tasks. I find myself repeating the same patterns with `ansible`
all the time, so I want a collection of patterns that I've worked out, stored in one place, which I can pull to any 
environment and reuse. 

I use my own `ansible_kvm_cluster` repository to spin up cluster and to experiment and try out new patterns. 
```
>> git clone git@github.com:bmduffy/ansible_kvm_cluster.git
```
